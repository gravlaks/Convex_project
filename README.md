## Overview

An efficient Gauss Newton approach using randomized projection based on [1]  is implemented. Improvements are made to mitigate overshooting. A fully modular implementation allows for testing the  algorithm on arbitrarily structured neural networks.

2 algorithms are used as a baseline for our approach: Algo 1 that does per-sample projection, algo 2 that does full jacobian projection.

## Results:
